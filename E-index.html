		 Welcome to Bridges of the American West
		 </h2>
	     <p>
	     The American West is a rugged region covered with
         mountains, canyons, rivers, ravines. Perhaps more than
         other regions of the American landscape, the West posed
         problems for settlers as they attempted to traverse its
         varied terrain.

		 Applying the best in human imagination and scientific
         knowledge, engineers have developed a vast network of
         highways and bridges to enable the easy movement of goods
         and travelers from coast to coast. This Web project tells
         about a few bridges of the western United States and the
         contributions they have made in the taming of the Wild
         West.
