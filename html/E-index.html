    Welcome to Bridges of the American West
</h2>
<p>
    The American West is a rugged region covered with
    mountains, canyons, rivers, and ravines. Perhaps more than
    other regions of the American landscape, the West posed
    problems for settlers as they attempted to traverse its
    varied terrain.

<p>
    Applying the best in human imagination and scientific
    knowledge, engineers have developed a vast network of
    highways and bridges to enable the easy movement of goods
    and travelers from coast to coast. This Web project tells
    about a few bridges of the western United States and the
    contributions they have made in the taming of the Wild
    West.
